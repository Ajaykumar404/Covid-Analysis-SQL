## Covid Data Exploration and Analysis 
- Analyzing covid deaths and vaccinations for whole world and India
- Data Source -  ourworldindata
- finding highest death counts
- finding percatnges of deaths and total vaccinations with respect to population
- Analysis of data on country and continent level

#### Steps
- reading the data
- Cleaning for missing values
- seperating data on country, continents level
- finding useful dates for analysis for vaccinations

import pandas as pd
import pandasql as ps
cd = pd.read_excel("https://github.com/Siddharthbadal/SQL/blob/main/dataset/covidDeaths.xlsx?raw=true", sheet_name="covidDeaths")
cd.head()

finding total new deaths globally in comparision with total new cases
